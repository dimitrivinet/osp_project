# USAGE:

To use a .c file, execute the command:
    make <file name (without extension)>
    ex: make hello

This unmounts a directory if one with the same name exists and is mounted, deletes then recreates it, and (re-)mounts the new filesystem to it.

To clean all directories and their mounts, use:
    make clean
    
hello: done
to_console: bug avec l'affichage du message voulu + cant get current shell pid
shutdown: done
write: not begun
folder: not begun
udpdate: done ? cant get current shell pid
